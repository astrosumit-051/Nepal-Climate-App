# Nepal-Climate-App

An interactive, data-driven application designed to assist policymakers in Nepal in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation and capital investment in areas most affected or prone to weather-related events. The dashboard integrates daily weather data collected from **62 districts** across Nepal over a **20-year period (2000â€“2020)**, enabling users to visualize trends, patterns, and vulnerabilities associated with various weather conditions.  

By leveraging dynamic visualizations, statistical analyses, and geospatial mapping, the dashboard provides actionable insights that help policymakers identify high-risk regions, assess historical weather impacts, and strategically divert funding toward mitigation efforts. This tool enhances **data-driven decision-making** by ensuring that limited resources are allocated efficiently, reducing the socio-economic impact of extreme weather events.
